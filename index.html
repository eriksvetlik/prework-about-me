      <p>
        I find programming to be interesting and challenging. It's like trying
        to solve a puzzle in another language, and I like trying to figure
        things out. I really enjoy learning knew things and solving problems,
        and programming is a field that really allows me to continue to learn
        and flex my mind. I also get a great sense of pride and accomplishment
        once I finish a program and everything works.
